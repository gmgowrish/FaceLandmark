# FaceLandmark

A set of 64 face landmarks typically includes key points that represent various facial features such as eyes, nose, mouth, and other facial contours. These landmarks are essential for tasks like facial recognition, facial expression analysis, and facial feature tracking.


The coordinates of these landmarks can be obtained through facial landmark detection algorithms, which are often based on deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These algorithms analyze facial images and identify the positions of predefined points on the face.


## 68-point shape predictor
The 68-point shape predictor is often associated with the dlib library, a popular open-source toolkit for machine learning and computer vision tasks. The shape predictor in dlib is capable of detecting and predicting the positions of 68 facial landmarks in images.

1. Install dlib: You can install dlib using package managers like pip in Python. For example:
 ```bash
  pip install dlib
```
2.The imutils library provides convenience functions for various image processing tasks and simplifies the use of OpenCV in some cases
 ```bash
  pip install imutils
```
3.opencv-python is a Python binding for OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library), which is a powerful and widely used open-source computer vision and machine learning library.
 ```bash
  pip install opencv-python
```

4. Download the pre-trained model: The shape predictor requires a pre-trained model file. You can download the model file from the dlib website. As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, you could find the file here:http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2
